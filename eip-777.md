## Preamble

    EIP: 777
    Title: A New Advanced Token Standard
    Author: Jordi Baylina @jbaylina
    Type: Standard Track
    Category: ERC
    Status: Draft
    Created: 2017-11-19

## Simple Summary

Creates a standard interface for a token contract.

## Abstract

This standard defines a new way to interact with a Token Contract. This standard takes advantage of [ERC672](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/672)

## Motivation

This standard tries to improve the widely used ERC20 token. The main advantages of this contract are:

1. Uses the same philosophy that Ether is used when tokens are sent. `send(dest, value, data)`.
2. A tokenFallback can be defined in any contract and in any regular address in a way that this code is triggered when tokens are received. This avoids the double call needed in the ERC20 standard.
3. Contracts and regular addresses can control which contracts are authorized to be received.
4. The token holder can "authorize" and "deauthorize" operators that can manage their tokens. This operators generally are going to be verified contracts like an exchange, a check processor or an automatic charging system.
5. Besides the `bytes data` field, a `bytes32 ref` field is also added in each payment that can be freely used by the operators and the users.
6. It can be used in a backwards compatible way with wallets that do not contain the `tokenFallback` function

## Specification

```
interface IToken {
    function name() public constant returns (string);
    function symbol() public constant returns (bytes32);
    function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint256);
    function decimals() public constant returns (uint8);
    function balanceOf(address owner) public constant returns (uint256);
    function send(address to, uint256 value) public;
    function send(address to, uint256 value, bytes data) public;
    function send(address to, uint256 value, bytes data, bytes32 ref) public;

    function authorizeOperator(address operator, bool authorized) public;
    function isOperatorAuthorizedFor(address operator, address tokenHoler) public constant returns (bool);
    function operatorSend(address from, address to, uint256 amount, bytes data, bytes32 ref) public;

    event Send(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value, bytes data, bytes32 indexed ref, address operator);
    event AuthorizeOperator(address indexed holder, address indexed operator, bool authorize);
}
```

The token must use EIP-672 to implement IERC777

Any recipient can define a `ITokenFallback` interface via EIP-672

```
interface ITokenFallback {
    function tokenFallback(address _from, address _to, uint _value, bytes _data, bytes32 _ref) public;
}
```

## Rationale

This standard solves some of the problems of the ERC223 and goes an este farder by allawing operators (generally contracts) that can manage the tokens in the same way that the ERC20 with infinite `approve` was allowed.

Also the usage of EIP672 allows backwards compatibility with wallets and proxy contracts without having to be redeployed.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP does not uses `transfer` and `transferFrom` and uses `send` and `operatorSendto` avoid mistakes in knowing which interface you are using. The main problem is that if you use a `transfer` in a token that the user think itâ€™s a ERC777 token but it is an ERC20 token, the tokens could be locked in a contract.

This stadard permits the implementation of ERC20 methods `transfer`, `transferFrom` and approve but they should be limited to only being called from old contracts.

This functions will call the tokenFallback function. And will return true or throw. They will never return false.

When the destination address does not implement ITokenFallback, the recomended action to do is:
1.- If the destinattion is a regular address then accept the Send.
2.- If the destination is a contract and the call is made from a `send` or a `operatorSend` then throw.
3.- If the call is made from the ERC20 `transfer` throw.
4.- If the call is made from the ERC20 `transferFrom` accept it.
