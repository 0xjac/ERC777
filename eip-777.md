    Title: A New Advanced Token Standard
    Author: Jordi Baylina @jbaylina, Jacques Dafflon @jacquesd, Thomas Shababi @tshabs
    Type: Standard Track
    Category: ERC
    Status: Draft
    Created: 2017-11-19
    Requires: 672 (draft)

## Simple Summary

Creates a standard interface for a token contract.

## Abstract

This standard defines a new way to interact with a Token Contract. This standard takes advantage of [EIP-672](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/672) to notify contracts when they receive tokens and to be compatible with old contracts.

## Motivation

This standard tries to improve the widely used [ERC-20](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/20) token standard. The main advantages of this standard are:

1. Uses the same philosophy as Ether in that tokens are sent with `send(dest, value, data)`.
2. A `tokensReceived` can be defined in any contract and in any regular address in a way that this code is triggered when tokens are received. This avoids the double call needed in the ERC-20 standard.
3. Both contracts and regular addresses can control and reject which tokens they receive by registering a `tokensReceived` function which throws if the token contract address has been blacklisted.
4. The token holder can "authorize" and "revoke" operators who can manage their tokens. These operators generally are going to be verified contracts like an exchange, a check processor or an automatic charging system.
5. Every token transaction contains a `userData` bytes field and a similar `operatorData` -- in case of an operator transaction -- to be used freely by the user (sender) and the operator respectively to pass data to the recipient.
6. It can be used in a backwards compatible way with wallets that do not contain the `tokensReceived` function.

## Specification

### IToken (Token Contract)

``` ts
interface EIP777 {
    function name() public constant returns (string);
    function symbol() public constant returns (string);
    function decimals() public constant returns (uint8);
    function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint256);
    function balanceOf(address owner) public constant returns (uint256);
    function erc20compatible() public constant returns (bool);

    function send(address to, uint256 value) public;
    function send(address to, uint256 value, bytes userData) public;

    function authorizeOperator(address operator) public;
    function revokeOperator(address operator) public;
    function isOperatorAuthorizedFor(address operator, address tokenHolder) public constant returns (bool);
    function operatorSend(address from, address to, uint256 value, bytes userData, bytes operatorData) public;

    event Send(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value, address indexed operator, bytes userData, bytes operatorData);
    event Mint(address indexed to, uint256 amount, address indexed operator, bytes operatorData);
    event Burn(address indexed from, uint256 value);
    event AuthorizedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder);
    event RevokedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder);
}
```

The token must use EIP-672 to implement EIP-777.

#### Methods
##### name

``` ts
 function name() public constant returns (string)
```

Returns the name of the token - e.g. `"MyToken"`.

*Note*: This method SHOULD NOT be implemented explicitly. Instead declare a
public state variable (`string public name`) and let the solidity compiler create the getter.

> **returns:** Name of the token

<br/>

##### symbol

``` ts
function symbol() public constant returns (string)
```
Returns the symbol of the token. E.g.  `"MYT"`.

*Note*: This method SHOULD NOT be implemented explicitly. Instead declare a
public state variable (`string public symbol`) and let the solidity compiler
create the getter.

> **returns:** Symbol of the token

<br/>

##### decimals

``` ts
function decimals() public constant returns (uint8)
```
Returns the number of decimals the token uses - e.g. `8`, means to divide the token value by `100000000` to get its user representation.

*Note*: This method SHOULD NOT be implemented explicitly. Instead declare a
public state variable (`uint8 public decimals`) and let the solidity compiler
create the getter.

> **returns:** Number of decimals used by the token.

<br/>

##### totalSupply

``` ts
function totalSupply() public constant returns (uint256)
```
Get the total supply of minted tokens.

> **returns:** Total supply of tokens currently in circulation.

<br/>

##### balanceOf

``` ts
function balanceOf(address tokenHolder) public constant returns (uint256)
```
Get the account balance of the account with address `tokenHolder`.
> **parameters**
> - `tokenHolder`: Owner of the account for which the balance is returned
>
> **returns:** Amount of token held by `tokenHolder` in the token-contract.

<br/>

##### erc20compatible

``` ts
function erc20compatible() public constant returns (bool)
```
Indicate whether the token-contract is backwards compatible with ERC-20 and exposes the ERC-20 standard methods such as `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom`.

*NOTE*: If the contract does not implement ERC-20, then a simple function is acceptable. If the contract implement ERC-20, a `erc20compatible` public state variable should be used instead. When set to `false` the ERC-20 `transfer`, `approve`, `transferFrom` and `allowance` functions MUST be disabled by throwing. This behavior SHOULD be implemented with the use of a require: `require(erc20compatible)`.

> **returns:** `true` if the token-contract is ERC-20 compatible, `false` otherwise.

<br/>

##### send

``` ts
function send(address to, uint256 value) public
function send(address to, uint256 value, bytes userData) public
```

Send `value` amount of tokens to address `to`.

This call MUST fire the `Send` event. This call MUST call the `tokensReceived` method on the address implementing `ITokenRecipient` as returned by a EIP-672 reverse lookup on the `to` address, regardless if `to` is a regular address or a contract.

If `to` is a contract which does not implement `tokensReceived` as indicated by a EIP-672 reverse lookup, then the `send` MUST throw.

The function MUST `throw` if:
 - `msg.sender` account balance does not have enough tokens to spend
 - `to` is a contract that is not prepared to receive tokens. That is it is a contract that does not implements `ITokensReceived` interface and the hash of the source code is not in between the whitelisted codes listed in the appendix of this code.

*NOTE*: Sending a value of `0` is valid and MUST be treated as a regular send.
> **parameters**
> - `to`: tokens recipient
> - `value`: amount of tokens transferred
> - `userData`: information attached to the transaction by the sender

<br/>

##### authorizeOperator
``` ts
function authorizeOperator(address operator) public
```
Authorize a third party `operator` to manage (send) `msg.sender`'s tokens.

*NOTE*: The token holder (`msg.sender`) is always an operator for himself. That is, he can call `operatorSend` on himself. This right cannot be revoked. Therefore if this function is called to set the token holder (`msg.sender`) as operator, then the function MUST throw.

*NOTE*: A token holder CAN authorize multiple operators at the same time.

*NOTE*: A `AuthorizedOperator` event MUST be fired on a successful call to this function.

> **parameters**
> - `operator`: Address which will be granted rights to manage the tokens.

<br/>

##### revokeOperator
``` ts
function revokeOperator(address operator) public
```
Revoke a third party `operator`'s rights to manage (send) `msg.sender`'s tokens.

*NOTE*: The token holder (`msg.sender`) is always an operator for himself. That is, he can call `operatorSend` on himself. This right cannot be revoked. Therefore if this function is called to set the token holder (`msg.sender`) as operator, then the function MUST throw.

*NOTE*: A `RevokedOperator` event MUST be fired on a successful call to this function.

> **parameters**
> - `operator`: Address which whose rights to manage the tokens will be revoked.

<br/>

##### isOperatorAuthorizedFor

``` ts
function isOperatorAuthorizedFor(address operator, address tokenHolder) public constant returns (bool)
```

Check whether the `operator` address is allowed to manage the tokens held by the `tokenHolder` address.

> **parameters**
> - `operator`: address to check if it has the right to manage the tokens.
> - `tokenHolder`: address which holds the tokens to be managed.

<br/>

##### operatorSend

``` ts
function operatorSend(address from, address to, uint256 value, bytes userData, bytes operatorData) public
```

Send `value` amount of tokens from the address `from` to the address `to`.

`msg.sender` MUST be an authorized operator or the owner for the `from` address.

This call MUST fire the `Send` event. This call MUST call the `tokensReceived` method on the contract implementing `ITokenRecipient` as returned by a EIP-672 reverse lookup on the `to` address.

This call MUST NOT call `tokensReceived` if a EIP-672 reverse lookup does not return an address implementing `ITokenRecipient`.

The method MUST throw if:
 - `from` account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.
 - `to` is a contract which does not register an address (its own or another) via ENS which implement the `ITokenRecipient` interface.
 - `msg.sender` is not an authorized operator for `from`.

*NOTE*: The `from` address MUST first call `authorizeOperator` on an address to allow this address to call `operatorSend` on behalf of the `from` address.

> **parameters**
> - `from`: token holder (sender)
> - `to`: tokens recipient
> - `value`: amount of tokens transferred
> - `userData`: information attached to the transaction, previously provided by the sender (`from` address).
> - `operatorData`: information attached to the transaction by the operator

*NOTE*: The operator is free to pass any data via the `operatorData` parameter but the `userData` parameter is reserved for data provided by the sender. The sender should provide this data to the operator beforehand.

<br/>

#### Events

##### Send

``` ts
event Send(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value, bytes userData, address indexed operator, bytes operatorData)
```

Indicate a transaction of `value` amount tokens from the `from` address to the `to` address.

This event MUST be fired on a successful call to `send` and `operatorSend`.

> **parameters**
> - `from`: token holder (sender)
> - `to`: tokens recipient
> - `value`: number of tokens transferred
> - `userData`: information attached to the transaction by the sender
> - `operator`: address who triggered the transfer, either sender for a direct send or an authorized operator for `operatorSend`
> - `operatorData`: information attached to the transaction by the operator

<br/>

##### Mint

``` ts
event Mint(address indexed to, uint256 value)
```

Indicate the minting of `value` amount tokens to the `to` address.

This standard does not enforce a specific way to mint tokens as this can be done in various ways depending on the use case of the tokens.

However, this event MUST be fired every time tokens are minted and credited to a `to` recipient address. A `Send` event (even with the `0x0` `from` address) MUST NOT be fired.

> **parameters**
> - `to`: tokens recipient
> - `value`: amount of tokens minted

###### `tokensReceived` for minting

Every mint MUST call `tokensReceived` on the address implementing `ITokenRecipient` for the `to` address as returned by a EIP-672 reverse lookup.

Calls to `tokensReceived` **f `to` is a contract and the ERC-672 lookup does not return an address implementing `tokensReceived`, the minting MUST follow the same rules as for a send: it MUST throw.

The `from` parameter of `tokensReceived` MUST be `0x0`. The operator MUST be `msg.sender`. The `userData` MUST be empty. `operatorData` MAY contain data related to the minting.

<br/>

##### Burn

``` ts
event Burn(address indexed from, uint256 value)
```

Indicate the burning of `value` amount tokens from the `from` address.

This standard does not enforce a specific way to burn tokens as this can be done in various ways depending on the use case of the tokens.

However, this event MUST be fired every time tokens are burnt and taken from a `from` recipient address. A `Send` event (even with the `0x0` `to` address) MUST NOT be fired.

> **parameters**
> - `from`: tokens holder
> - `value`: amount of tokens burnt

<br/>

##### AuthorizeOperator

``` ts
event AuthorizedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder)
```

Indicate that the `operator` address is allowed to manage the token of (i.e. is an operator for) the address `tokenHolder`.

This event MUST be fired on a successful call to `authorizeOperator`.

> **parameters**
> - `operator`: Address which is granted rights to manage the tokens.
> - `tokenHolder`: address which holds the tokens to be managed.

<br/>

##### RevokedOperator

``` ts
event AuthorizedOperator(address indexed operator, address indexed tokenHolder)
```

Indicate that the `operator` address is denied the rights to manage the token of (i.e. is not operator for) the address `tokenHolder`.

This event MUST be fired on a successful call to `revokeOperator`.

> **parameters**
> - `operator`: Address which is denied the rights to manage the tokens.
> - `tokenHolder`: address which holds the tokens to be managed.

<br/>

### ITokenRecipient

Any recipient can define the `ITokenRecipient` interface via EIP-672.

```
interface ITokenRecipient {
  function tokensReceived(address from, address to, uint amount, bytes userData, address operator, bytes operatorData) public
}
```
#### Methods

##### tokensReceived

``` ts
function tokensReceived(address from, address to, uint amount, bytes userData, address operator, bytes operatorData) public;
```

Notify the transmission of `value` amount tokens from the `from` address to the `to` address.

###### Minting Versus Sending

When tokens are received as a result of minting, the `from` address MUST be `0x0` and the `userData` MUST be empty. `operator` MUST be the address who initiated the minting and `operatorData` MAY contain data.

When tokens are received as a result of sending (`send` or `operatorSend`), the `from` address MUST be the one from which the tokens originate and MUST NOT be `0x0`. If it is a direct `send` (i.e. not an `operatorSend`) the `operator` MUST the address from which the tokens originate. That is the `from` and `operator` addresses MUST be equals.

> **parameters**
> - `from`: token holder (sender)
> - `to`: tokens recipient
> - `value`: number of tokens transferred
> - `userData`: information attached to the transaction by the sender
> - `operator`: address who triggered the transfer, either sender for a direct send or an authorized operator for `operatorSend`
> - `operatorData`: information attached to the transaction by the operator

## Rationale

This standard solves some of the problems of the [EIP-223](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223) and goes an step further by allowing operators (generally contracts) that can manage the tokens in the same way that the ERC-20 with infinite `approve` was allowed.

Also the usage of EIP-672 allows backwards compatibility with wallets and proxy contracts without having to be redeployed.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP does not introduce backward incompatibilities and is compatible with the older ERC-20 token standard.

This EIP does not uses `transfer` and `transferFrom` and uses `send` and `operatorSend` to avoid mistakes in knowing which interface you are using.

This standard allows the implementation of ERC-20 functions `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `approve` and `allowance` to make a token compatible with ERC-20.

Therefore a token contract can implement both ERC-20 and EIP-777 in parallel. Read-only functions (such as `name`, `symbol`, `balanceOf`, `totalSupply`) and internal data (such as the mapping of balances) overlap without problem. The write methods from both standards are decoupled and can operate independently from each other. Note that ERC-20 functions SHOULD be limited to only being called from old contracts.

In any case, a EIP-777 compliant token-contract MUST implement the `erc20compatible()` function and if it do not wish to be compatible with ERC-20,
simply return `false`.

The only difference for new contracts implementing ERC-20 is that registration of `ITokenRecipient` via EIP-672 takes precedence over ERC-20. This means that even with on a ERC-20 `transfer` call, the token contract MUST check via EIP-672 if the `to` address implements `tokensReceived` and call it if available. Note that when calling ERC-20 `transfer` on a contract, if the contract does not implement `tokensReceived`, the `transfer` call SHOULD still be accepted even if this means the tokens will probably be locked.

The table below summarize the different actions the token contract must take when sending, minting and transferring token via EIP-777 and ERC-20:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>EIP-672</th>
    <th><code>to</code> address<br></th>
    <th>EIP-777 <code>send</code>/<code>operatorSend</code> and Minting<br></th>
    <th>ERC-20 <code>transfer</code><br></th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2"><code>ITokenRecipient</code> registered<br></td>
    <td>to Regular address</td>
    <td colspan="2" rowspan="2">Call <code>tokensReceived</code><br></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>to Contract</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2"><code>ITokenRecipient</code> not registered</td>
    <td>to Regular address</td>
    <td>SHOULD accept<br></td>
    <td rowspan="2">SHOULD accept<br></td>
